### Short Demonstration of My Adept Setup

Several people have asked about how I operate my Adept, so I’ve uploaded a short demonstration video.
For clarity, I exaggerated my hand movements during recording to make it easier to understand.

---

#### 1. Top Right Button (4th Button)

My ring finger naturally rests on this button.
A **tap** performs a **right-click**, while a **hold** enables **drag scroll mode**.
When you hold and roll the ball, it performs scrolling in all directions — vertical, horizontal, and diagonal — just like a mouse wheel.
Unlike a typical mouse, horizontal and vertical scrolling are integrated, allowing smooth multidirectional movement.
This is extremely convenient when working with **Excel spreadsheets** or **large images**.

Because of the strong inertia from the **BTU bearing system**, you can perform long, smooth scrolls similar to Logitech’s **infinite scroll**.
When held, this button also activates **Layer 1**, which merges drag scroll functionality with layer switching — a feature not available on the original Adept.
Thus, you can **scroll and access layer functions simultaneously**.

On my setup, I mapped **End** (thumb, bottom-left) and **Home** (middle finger) to quickly move to the top or bottom of a page while dragging.
Other keys are mapped to features like **DPI change**, **screenshot**, and **Alt+F4**, but these are just personal preferences — feel free to customize them.

#### 2. Bottom Left Button

A **tap** triggers the **Back** command.
A **hold** activates **Layer 2**, where the ball controls **volume adjustment**.
This is by far the most convenient volume control method I’ve ever used.
On Layer 2, I’ve also mapped several **macros** I use frequently.

---

#### 3. Top Middle Button (3rd Button)

My middle finger always rests on this button, which is assigned to **middle-click**.
I use middle-click very often, so I appreciate that the Adept lets my finger stay in contact with the button at all times — something missing from devices like the **Kensington Expert Mouse** or other popular trackballs.

With the middle button, I can **open or close browser tabs** easily.
In **Fusion 360**, holding the middle button pans the canvas.
Since middle-click hold isn’t needed in daily browsing, I combined it with **tab-switching shortcuts** in Chrome.
However, if you use an application that relies on middle-click hold, you may experience conflicts.
This button does **not** have any layer function.

#### 4. Base Layer Features

Layer 0 is used for normal pointer movement.
However, when the ball is rolled **above a certain speed**, it triggers specific **shortcut actions**.
I mapped these to **virtual desktop switching** (left/right).
It doesn’t trigger with slow movements, so normal usage isn’t affected.
I initially experimented with up/down gestures as well, but found them impractical — so I removed them.

#### 5. Vial and Customization

This firmware fully supports **Vial**, allowing you to use **Tap Dance** and other advanced features.
I’ve explained the layer functions in detail above, so you can easily customize key mappings to suit your own workflow.

The **source files** including keymaps are provided.
You can adjust the **DPI**, **scroll sensitivity**, and other settings in QMK and compile them yourself.
For those unfamiliar with QMK, I’ve also included a **compiled UF2 file** — simply reset the device, drag and drop the file into the popup window, and it will flash automatically.

This is **my personal keymap**, and I encourage you to fine-tune the options as you like.
I cannot provide post-support for code modifications or personal adjustments.
