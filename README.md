### Printing Instructions

**Top shell**

* Must be printed in **MJF Nylon PA12**.
* **FDM printing is *not recommended*** — the button structure was modeled specifically for the stiffness of nylon.
* Using other materials may result in poor button feel or tolerance issues.

**Bottom shell**

* Can be printed using **FDM**.
* When ordering from **JLC3DP**, even the cheapest resin worked fine.
* To minimize thickness, the **sensor area is exposed** at the bottom.

  * If you don’t like this, you can modify the model yourself or simply cover it with tape.

**Frame**

* The **MJF Nylon PA12** version fits perfectly.
* The **FDM** version may not fit properly due to printing tolerance differences.
* If you own a 3D printer and are experienced, you can adjust tolerances manually.

### Hardware / Assembly

* **Total screws needed:** 3

  * **Rear:** 2 × M2 (4 mm recommended, 5–6 mm also fit)
  * **Front:** 1 × M1.6 (5 mm)

    * The front screw hole is hidden for a clean look and fits like a LEGO brick connection, which is why it’s smaller.
* **Recommended bumpon (rubber foot) diameter:** 8 mm

### BTU Adapter

You **must use the BTU adapter (support)** included in this repository — it has slightly different dimensions compared to the original design.
